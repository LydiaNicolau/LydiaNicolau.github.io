      <h1>Some Information About my Apps!</h1>
      <p> Below you will find the app I have created in my csc106 class! The app me and my partner have made is checkers. We made this app in hopes that it would <br> entertain all players. We used Javascript when making this app and are very happy with the outcome. To play the game click on the start button and then once <br> on the game screen select the checker piece you want to move, and move it. You can play this game against yourself or with a friend! Enjoy!</p>
